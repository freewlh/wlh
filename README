TRANSLATION PROTOCOL

1. The Chinese article should be broken into lines, while keeping paragraph
breaks. Each line is preceded with ">>" so that it is clear.

2. Below each line, append the English translation, for easy comparison.

3. At the end of each completed English translation, append your initial. For
example, [W] or [G], etc. A line without initial would mean that it is still
work in progress.

4. A line with two initials, e.g., [W][G], would mean that it has been first
translated by [W], and then verified by [G]. (So this line is essentially
done).

5. If there are doubts or discussion, then put something like [W: comment] by
the phrase of discussion (any where in the sentence), where W is your initial
and "comment" can be any thing.

6. After all lines are completed, it is easy to remove all >> lines, and all
[.] comments.

7. Make sure that paragraph breaks (empty lines) are preserved - no deletion
or addition, unless breaking into paragraphs improves readability.
